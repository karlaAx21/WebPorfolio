        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>After graduating from High school, I went to southwestern college in Chula Vista, I tool time to get all my cretits becouse I was 
            not confident in my English, which is my second language, it took me some time to get confidense in my english. After some years I 
            apply for multiple univesities and CSUF was one of them that accept me and decides to go there. Also, I am really easy to work and 
            as I learn more about the job I think more independenly. Always give my best at trying to undestand the job so I can be more independent
            from a manager or a team leader. I also rarely feel insulted as I use to work in the custumer service industry, I can understad that
            some people is going throught a lot an do not juge them, as this is the last think they need rihtg now.
